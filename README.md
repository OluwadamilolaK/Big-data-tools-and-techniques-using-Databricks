# Big-data-tools-and-techniques-using-Databricks
In this task, we will explore the use of Apache Spark on Databricks to analyse clinical trial data and pharmaceutical company information. The goal is to learn about different facets of clinical trialsâ€”such as study types, popular diseases, leading sponsors, and concluded studies.

The following datasets are available for analysis:
Clinical Trial Data: This dataset includes study types, conditions, sponsors, and completion statuses for individual clinical trials.
Pharmaceutical Company Information: This dataset offers details on pharmaceutical companies, including parent companies and violations.

DataFrames, Spark SQL, and Spark RDDs will be used in the analysis.
Our goal in performing these analyses is to offer insightful information about the clinical trial landscape and pharmaceutical involvement, information that will help guide future research initiatives and decision-making processes. We will guarantee data accuracy throughout the analysis, address any possible inconsistencies, and clearly present the findings.
